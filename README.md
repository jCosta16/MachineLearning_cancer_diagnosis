# Breast Cancer Diagnostics using Machine Learning

In this project we whish to apply machine learning models to numeric data, of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass and Images of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC), to decide which tool has the highest accuracy in automated cancer classification.

For the image analysis, our aim is to create a model that predicts whether the image represents cancerous cells (1) or non-cancerous cells (0). 
For the numeric data, the predictor category is benign versus malignant, based on features such as the cell area, smoothness, texture, etc.

Currently, our numeric data classifier has an accuracy of ~96% and our image classifier has an accuracy of 85%.
